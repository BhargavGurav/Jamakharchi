<p>This is a WebApp created using Django framework by me. It has a nice responsive UI.</p>
<p>Basically I have created it for recording expenses if one record those expenses in diary and 
sometimes diary get lost or due to some household world it get torned or pages gets oil on them or water. 
So this webapp helps to record the expense entry in simple manner.</p>
<p>It takes date of expenditure, amount, purpose and closing amount and save it and show on UI. 
And also if user want to download the statement for some range of dates then he/she can download it neat and clean.</p>
